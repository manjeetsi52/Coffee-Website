### ðŸ’¡ What is `::before`?
* It creates an **extra box** (pseudo-element) **before** the real content of `header`.
* Think of it like a ghost element layered on top of the page.
* But by default, itâ€™s invisible unless you tell it **what to show** using `content`.

#### `content: ""`

* This **activates** the `::before` element.
* Even though it's empty (`""`), itâ€™s now a real visual element.
* Without `content`, the `::before` wonâ€™t render at all.

ðŸ”¸ Think of it like saying: **"Show an invisible box."**

#### `position: fixed`
* This makes the box **stick to the screen**, not just the header.
* It doesnâ€™t scroll â€” it's **fixed in place**.

ðŸ”¸ Like sticking a sticker to your phone screen â€” it stays still even when the page scrolls.

#### `left: 0` and `top: 0`
* This says: **Start the box at the top-left corner** of the screen (or viewport).
* Itâ€™s the anchor point.

#### `width: 100%` and `height: 100%`
* This makes the box cover **100% of the screen** (full width and height).
ðŸ”¸ So now, you have an invisible full-screen layer on top of everything.

#### `backdrop-filter: blur(5px)`
* This blurs **whatever is behind the box** â€” not the box itself.
* Result: Everything behind the menu becomes frosted or blurry.
